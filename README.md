# crypto-rates
My app checking the prices for cryptocurrencies available on: [crypto-rates online](https://sikorasebastian.github.io/crypto-rates/)

This app is fetching information about cryptocurrencies prices from CoinGecko api.
It displays the data in the form of a line chart. It is possible to choose between three different cryptocurrencies:
- Bitcoin
- Ethereum
- Litecoin

It is also possible to choose the currency in which the price is shown.
In order to fetch data you should choose start date and end date for the time range shown on the chart.
